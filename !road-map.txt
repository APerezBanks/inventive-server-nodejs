A Node + React app that receives photos of bills and uses OCR to create an inventory of goods:

1. Set up your development environment:
Install Node.js and npm.
Set up a project directory and initialize it with npm init.
Use a package like create-react-app or Vite to scaffold the React frontend.

2. Build the backend with Node.js + Express:
Install Express: npm install express.
Set up routes to handle image uploads and process them.
Use a library like multer for handling image uploads.

3. Add OCR capability:
Use Tesseract.js (a JavaScript OCR library) or an external OCR API like Google Cloud Vision, AWS Textract, or Azure Computer Vision.
Install Tesseract.js with npm install tesseract.js if you want a local solution.

4. Parse extracted text into an inventory:
Once the OCR extracts text from the bill, write logic to parse the text and identify goods, quantities, and prices.
You could use regular expressions or more advanced NLP libraries to improve data extraction.

5. Set up a database:
Use a database like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or SQLite to store inventory data.
Define models for your goods (name, quantity, price, etc.).
Use an ORM like Prisma or Mongoose (for MongoDB) to interact with the database.

6. Build the React frontend:
Create a form with an image upload feature.
Send the uploaded image to your backend API.
Show the extracted inventory in a clean and organized format.
Use state management (like Redux or React’s useState) if needed.

7. Connect frontend and backend:
Use Axios or Fetch API to send the image to your backend.
Handle responses and update frontend state.

8. Add some polish (optional but nice):
Add form validation and loading indicators.
Show a preview of the uploaded bill.
Allow users to manually adjust the parsed inventory if needed.
Add authentication if you want to manage different users’ inventories.

9. Deploy:
Deploy your frontend to services like Vercel or Netlify.
Deploy your backend on platforms like Render, DigitalOcean, or Heroku.
Use a cloud database (like MongoDB Atlas or Supabase) for remote storage.
